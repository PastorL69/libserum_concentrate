# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This document explains how `libserum` works end-to-end, with emphasis on runtime flow, scene handling, and cROMc persistence.

**Maintenance rule:** Any feature change, behavior change, data format change, or API/signature change in this repository **must** be reflected in this file in the same PR/commit.
**Formatting rule:** Code formatting in this repository is defined by
`.clang-format`. Any code changes must be formatted accordingly before they are
considered done.

**Platform-independence rule:** `libserum` is intended to behave the same on
all supported platforms. Runtime behavior, persisted `cROMc` semantics, and
derived lookup data must not depend on whether the archive was generated on
Windows, macOS, or Linux. If equal source data is loaded/generated, the
resulting `v6` `cROMc` content and runtime behavior are expected to be
platform-independent.

## High-level architecture
Core files:
- `src/serum-decode.cpp`: Main runtime engine (load, identify, colorize, rotate, scene orchestration).
- `src/SerumData.h/.cpp`: In-memory model + cROMc serialization/deserialization.
- `src/SceneGenerator.h/.cpp`: PUP scene CSV parsing + runtime scene frame generation.
- `src/sparse-vector.h`: Sparse/compressed storage for frame and asset blocks.
- `src/serum.h`: Public constants/flags/structs.
- `src/serum-decode.h`: Public C API declarations.
- `src/serum-version.h`: Library and concentrate format versions.

Main global runtime state (in `serum-decode.cpp`):
- Loaded data model: `g_serumData`.
- Current output: `mySerum` (`Serum_Frame_Struc`).
- Scene playback state: `sceneFrameCount`, `sceneCurrentFrame`, duration/flags/repeat, etc.
- Identification state: `lastfound`, `lastfound_normal`, `lastfound_scene`, CRC tracking.
- Public C API entrypoints are serialized through a recursive runtime mutex
  because this state is process-global and scene rendering may re-enter
  colorization internally. `Serum_Rotate()` must not run concurrently with
  `Serum_Colorize()` while shared output buffers, flags, widths, rotation
  tables, or scene state are being updated.
- Scene lookup acceleration:
  - `g_serumData.frameIsScene`: frame ID -> scene/non-scene marker.
  - `g_serumData.sceneFramesBySignature`: `(mask,shape,hash)` -> matching scene frame IDs.
  - `g_serumData.sceneFrameIdByTriplet`: `(sceneId,group,frameIndex)` -> frame ID.

## SparseVector storage and compression
`SparseVector` now supports both legacy map payloads and packed sparse blobs.

Packed sparse payload format (used for v6 save):
- `packedIds`
- `packedOffsets`
- `packedSizes`
- `packedBlob`

Behavior:
- Packed payloads are deduplicated by payload content at pack time.
- Optional adaptive value packing exists for `uint8_t` payloads:
  - per-payload mode is derived from actual max value and encoded in payload header
  - 1-bit mode for values in `0..1`
  - 2-bit mode for values in `0..3`
  - 4-bit mode for values in `0..15`
  - fallback to raw 8-bit payload otherwise
- Value packing preserves exact values for packed modes (no nonzero->1 normalization).
- Packed vectors can still be modified at runtime (`set()`); mutable map storage is restored lazily when needed.
- Runtime lookup uses dense index fast-path when IDs are dense.
- Packed sparse vectors track packed-index readiness separately from the
  optional dense index. Sparse high-ID vectors may intentionally use only the
  hash index, and runtime reads must not rebuild that hash index on every
  access just because no dense index was allocated.
- Compressed sparse vectors keep a tiny bounded decoded cache (6 entries, LRU
  replacement) in addition to the last/second hot-entry cache, reducing decode
  churn for alternating IDs without large RAM growth.

Vector policy currently used in `SerumData`:
- `dyna4cols_v2` and `dyna4cols_v2_extra` are LZ4-compressed sparse vectors.
- `backgroundmask` and `backgroundmask_extra` use adaptive value packing + LZ4 compression.
- Sentinel-based vectors are normalized and packed with boolean sidecars:
  - `spriteoriginal` + `spriteoriginal_opaque`
  - `spritemask_extra` + `spritemask_extra_opaque`
  - `spritedescriptionso` + `spritedescriptionso_opaque`
  - `dynamasks` + `dynamasks_active`
  - `dynamasks_extra` + `dynamasks_extra_active`
  - `dynaspritemasks` + `dynaspritemasks_active`
  - `dynaspritemasks_extra` + `dynaspritemasks_extra_active`
  - During normalization, dynamic value vectors may preserve an explicit
    all-zero payload only when the paired active sidecar still marks active
    pixels; this is required because dynamic layer `0` is a valid value and is
    not equivalent to "no payload".
  - The pre-normalization source vectors for `dynamasks*` and
    `dynaspritemasks*` must retain legacy `255` no-data sentinel semantics so
    an all-layer-`0` active payload is not dropped before sidecar generation.
  - `BuildPackingSidecarsAndNormalize()` also snapshots each generated sidecar
    payload into `m_packingSidecarsStorage` as a transient two-dimensional byte
    store (`std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>>`).
- Precomputed frame-level dynamic fast flags are persisted:
  - `frameHasDynamic`
  - `frameHasDynamicExtra`
- Additional prepared-load metadata is persisted for direct `v6` startup:
  - `hasAnyExtraFrame`
  - `publicTriggerCount`
  - `Serum_LoadConcentratePrepared(...)` uses these to avoid whole-frame scans
    for extra-frame availability and public-trigger counting on direct `v6`
    loads.
- `Colorize_Framev1/v2` uses these flags to bypass dynamic-mask branches
  entirely for frames without active dynamic pixels.
- Runtime frame rendering must not rely on `activeframes` alone: frames with
  background-only or dynamic-only content are still renderable and must pass
  the render gate even when static base pixels are absent.
- Color rotations use a precomputed lookup index:
  `colorRotationLookupByFrameAndColor[(frameId,isExtra,color)] -> (rotation,position)`
  restored from v6 cROMc when present.
  - v5 / authoring-time rebuild flows may rebuild the lookup before re-save.
  - v6 persistence stores this derived lookup in canonical sorted-entry form
    rather than direct `unordered_map` archive order, so `cROMc` output stays
    platform-independent and deterministic for identical source data.
  - `ColorInRotation` uses lookup-only runtime path (no linear scan fallback).
- Critical monochrome trigger frames use a precomputed lookup:
  `criticalTriggerFramesBySignature[(mask,shape,hash)] -> frameId(s)`
  restored from v6 cROMc when present and rebuilt during frame-lookup
  preprocessing otherwise.
- Sprite runtime sidecars are precomputed and used by `Check_Spritesv2`:
  - frame candidate list with sprite slot indices (`spriteCandidateOffsets`,
    `spriteCandidateIds`, `spriteCandidateSlots`)
  - frame-level shaped-sprite marker (`frameHasShapeSprite`)
  - per-sprite dimensions and shape flags (`spriteWidth`, `spriteHeight`,
    `spriteUsesShape`)
  - flattened detection metadata (`spriteDetectOffsets`, `spriteDetectMeta`)
  - per-sprite opaque row-segment runs (`spriteOpaqueRowSegmentStart`,
    `spriteOpaqueRowSegmentCount`, `spriteOpaqueSegments`)
  - `BuildSpriteRuntimeSidecars()` also snapshots the generated runtime sidecar
    vectors into `m_packingSidecarsStorage` as raw byte copies.
- Runtime uses sidecar flags instead of `255` sentinels for transparency / dynamic-zone activity.
- Runtime does not include sentinel-based fallback in sprite/dynamic helpers;
  missing/incorrect sidecars are treated as a conversion/load bug and are not
  masked by `255` compatibility logic.
- Dynamic-zone value vectors (`dynamasks*`, `dynaspritemasks*`) use adaptive
  value packing + compression, with sidecar active flags for sentinel-free
  semantics.
- `compmasks` and `backgroundmask*` are already boolean-mask domain (`mask==0`
  include / `>0` exclude) and therefore do not need separate transparency
  sidecar vectors.

## Load flow
Entry point: `Serum_Load(altcolorpath, romname, flags)`.

Requested-output mode:
- `FLAG_REQUEST_FALLBACK` extends single-plane extra-resolution requests.
- If the caller requests only the extra-resolution output plane
  (`FLAG_REQUEST_64P_FRAMES` for 32p source content, or
  `FLAG_REQUEST_32P_FRAMES` for 64p source content), libserum enters an
  extra-preferred runtime mode.
- In that mode without `FLAG_REQUEST_FALLBACK`, runtime renders only the extra
  plane and skips original-plane frame/rotation preparation entirely.
- In that mode with `FLAG_REQUEST_FALLBACK`, runtime first tries the extra
  plane for each matched frame/scene frame; if that frame has no complete extra
  payload (frame/background/sprite coverage), runtime renders only the original
  plane as fallback for that call.
- Authoring/update load flows may still widen internal load flags so both
  planes remain available for `.cROMc` regeneration, but runtime output
  behavior must continue to follow the caller's original request flags.

1. Reset all runtime state via `Serum_free()`.
2. On real-machine runtime (`is_real_machine()==true`):
   - do not scan or apply `*.pup.csv`
   - ignore `skip-cromc.txt`
   - accept only `*.cROMc`
   - do not fall back to `*.cROM` or `*.cRZ`
3. On non-real-machine/runtime-update flows:
   - look for optional `*.pup.csv`
   - prefer loading `*.cROMc` unless `skip-cromc.txt` exists.
   - If `*.cROMc` starts with `CROM` magic, load via `SerumData::LoadFromFile`.
   - Otherwise, try encrypted in-memory load (`vault::read` + `SerumData::LoadFromBuffer`).
4. If cROMc load fails or is absent on non-real-machine/runtime-update flows,
   load `*.cROM`/`*.cRZ`.
   - Raw source loads are authoring/update inputs and may be re-saved as
     `*.cROMc` when runtime generation is not disabled through
     `Serum_SetGenerateCRomC(false)`.
   - When such a raw source load produces a new `*.cROMc`, libserum reloads
     that generated `*.cROMc` in the same load cycle so first-run behavior
     matches the next boot.
5. If CSV exists and format is v2, parse scenes via `SceneGenerator::parseCSV`.
   - If CSV parsing updates scene data for a loaded `*.cROMc` and runtime
     generation is enabled, libserum rewrites the `*.cROMc` and reloads it in
     the same load cycle so the current process immediately uses the persisted
     scene-aware data.
6. Set scene depth from color count when scenes are active.
7. Build or restore frame lookup acceleration:
   - If loaded from cROMc v6 and no CSV update in this run: use stored lookup
     via `InitFrameLookupRuntimeStateFromStoredData()`.
   - Otherwise: rebuild via `BuildFrameLookupVectors()`.
   - Stored `v6` lookup data is expected to be valid across supported
     platforms; do not introduce platform-specific load branching for direct
     `v6` runtime loads.
8. Build/normalize packing sidecars via `BuildPackingSidecarsAndNormalize()`.
   - This normalization/repair path is for source-data build flows and `v5`
     compatibility handling.
   - Direct `v6` cROMc runtime load is expected to consume already-normalized
     runtime-ready data instead of mutating or repairing it on device.
   - Direct `v5` cROMc load must rerun this step after deserialization because
     the persisted v5 format does not contain the normalized opacity/dynamic
     sidecars used by current runtime code.
9. Build or restore sprite runtime sidecars via `BuildSpriteRuntimeSidecars()`.
   - For direct `v6` cROMc loads, runtime sidecars are expected to be restored
     from file as final runtime data.
   - Rebuild-on-load behavior belongs to `v5` compatibility handling and
     authoring-time rebuild flows, not to the final-device direct `v6` path.
Important:
- `BuildFrameLookupVectors()` must run after final scene data is known for this load cycle.
- CSV parsing after loading can invalidate stored scene lookup data and requires rebuild.
- Design policy:
  - `v5` backward-compatibility logic must remain scoped to `v5` loads.
  - `pup.csv`-driven rebuild/update logic is an authoring-time path and is not
    the target for memory-sensitive final-device runtime behavior.
  - Direct `v6` runtime load is expected to trust the stored runtime-ready data;
    do not add safety nets, compatibility shims, or repair logic for unreleased
    `v6` snapshot-to-snapshot compatibility on that path.
  - If a direct `v6` runtime load still needs mutation/repair to work, that is
    a generation/save contract bug and should be fixed at `cROMc` creation time
    rather than masked in the final-device load path.
  - The final-device direct `v6` load path must not run
    `BuildPackingSidecarsAndNormalize()` or rebuild missing sprite runtime
    sidecars on load.

## Frame identification
Main function: `Identify_Frame(uint8_t* frame, bool sceneFrameRequested)`.

Identification compares incoming original DMD frame against loaded frame definitions using:
- `compmaskID` (mask)
- `shapecompmode` (shape mode)
- `hashcodes` (precomputed CRC32 domain value)

Behavior:
- Matching starts from the stream-specific last found ID and wraps.
- Stream split is enforced:
  - normal search skips scene frames
  - scene search skips normal frames
  using `g_serumData.frameIsScene`.
- Scene requests use signature lookup in `sceneFramesBySignature` for the current `(mask,shape,hash)`.
- Normal-frame identification uses a persisted signature lookup in
  `normalFramesBySignature` to narrow candidates before applying the existing
  wrap-around / same-frame selection rules.
- Normal-frame identification does not include a fallback full-frame scan once
  `normalFramesBySignature` is available; missing/incorrect lookup data is a
  build/load contract bug rather than a runtime fallback case.
- Runtime normal identification iterates unique `(mask,shape)` buckets in
  frame-order relative to `lastfound_normal`, so frame-order semantics are
  preserved while each bucket hash is computed only once per input frame.
- Scene rendering can bypass generic scene identification when a direct triplet
  entry exists in `sceneFrameIdByTriplet`.
- During scene playback, direct-triplet mode uses libserum-owned timing
  (`sceneDurationPerFrame` plus a runtime next-frame timestamp) together with
  `SceneGenerator::updateAndGetCurrentGroup(...)`, and bypasses both
  `SceneGenerator::generateFrame(...)` and `Identify_Frame()` by supplying the
  precomputed `sceneFrameIdByTriplet` frame ID directly to the internal
  colorizer.
- Legacy same-frame behavior (`IDENTIFY_SAME_FRAME`) is preserved with full-frame CRC check.

Unknown-frame timeout state:
- `lastframe_found` timestamps the first consecutive unknown normal input, not
  the most recent legitimate frame.
- The timestamp is set once when normal identification returns
  `IDENTIFY_NO_FRAME`, remains unchanged while unknown inputs continue, and is
  cleared when a legitimate normal frame is accepted. Scene-render requests do
  not arm this unknown-input timeout.

Return values:
- `IDENTIFY_NO_FRAME` when no match.
- `IDENTIFY_SAME_FRAME` when same frame detected with same full CRC.
- matched frame ID otherwise.

## Scene lookup vector build
Function: `BuildFrameLookupVectors()`.

Goal: classify loaded frame IDs into scene/non-scene and build scene signature index.

How it works:
1. Initialize `frameIsScene` with all zeros.
2. If scene generator is active (v2 scene mode), pre-generate all scene frames:
   - iterate all scenes from `sceneGenerator->getSceneData()`
   - iterate all groups (`frameGroups`, default 1)
   - iterate all `frameIndex` values
   - generate with `generateFrame(..., disableTimer=true)`
3. Build scene signatures in identification domain:
   - collect unique `(mask,shape)` combinations from loaded frames
   - for every generated scene frame and every unique `(mask,shape)`, compute CRC via `calc_crc32`
4. For each loaded frame ID, if `(mask,shape,hashcodes[id])` signature is in scene signature set:
   - mark `frameIsScene[id] = 1`
   - add to `sceneFramesBySignature[signature]`.
5. Build `normalFramesBySignature` for all non-scene frames:
   - `(mask,shape,hash) -> matching normal frame IDs`
   - precompute flat normal identification buckets:
     - `normalIdentifyBuckets`
     - `frameToNormalBucket`
    - runtime normal identification uses this as a candidate source while still
      preserving wrap-around ordering relative to `lastfound_normal`.
    - runtime does not fall back to a linear normal-frame scan if this lookup is
      missing or inconsistent.
   - runtime walks precomputed `(mask,shape)` buckets in frame order and resolves
     matching frame IDs from the lookup, avoiding repeated per-frame hash
     computation inside the same bucket and avoiding per-frame bucket-dedup
     container overhead.
6. For v6 (`concentrateFileVersion >= 6`), precompute direct scene frame IDs:
   - generate each `(sceneId,group,frameIndex)` scene marker frame
   - identify it once
   - persist mapping in `sceneFrameIdByTriplet`.
   - Runtime playback then combines this triplet lookup with trigger-provided
     `sceneDurationPerFrame`; it does not regenerate marker frames on each
     scene tick.
7. During the same preprocessing pass, build critical monochrome-trigger
   signatures for non-scene frames:
   - include only frames with trigger IDs:
     - `MONOCHROME_TRIGGER_ID`
     - `MONOCHROME_PALETTE_TRIGGER_ID`
   - persist mapping in `criticalTriggerFramesBySignature`.
8. Initialize `lastfound_scene` / `lastfound_normal` from first available IDs.

Log line:
- `Loaded X frames and Y rotation scene frames`

Save-time invariant:
- `Serum_SaveConcentrate()` must set `SceneGenerator` depth from
  `g_serumData.nocolors` before `BuildFrameLookupVectors()`. Otherwise large
  v2 scene sets authored for 4-level scene markers can serialize empty derived
  scene lookup data even though the source `.pup.csv` parses successfully.

## Colorization flow (v2)
Entry point: `Serum_ColorizeWithMetadatav2(frame, sceneFrameRequested=false)`.

Main phases:
1. Identify frame ID via `Identify_Frame`.
2. Trigger / monochrome handling.
3. Scene trigger handling.
4. Render base frame via `Colorize_Framev2(...)`.
5. Optional background-scene overlay via second `Colorize_Framev2(..., applySceneBackground=true, ...)`.
6. Optional sprite overlays.
7. Configure color rotations and return next timer.

Preferred-extra runtime mode:
- When load flags request only the extra output plane, `Colorize_Framev2`
  treats extra resolution as the preferred render target.
- If `FLAG_REQUEST_FALLBACK` is not set, original-resolution output is not
  colorized for matched frames in that mode.
- If `FLAG_REQUEST_FALLBACK` is set, original-resolution output is colorized
  only on calls where `CheckExtraFrameAvailable(frameId)` fails; otherwise the
  original plane stays untouched for that frame.
- Rotation setup follows the same policy: only planes actually rendered on the
  current call receive fresh rotation tables/timers; inactive planes are reset
  so `Serum_Rotate()` does not keep rotating stale original-resolution output
  while extra-resolution output is active.

Dynamic-shadow hot path:
- `CheckDynaShadow(...)` receives pre-fetched per-frame shadow vectors
  (`dynashadowsdir*`, `dynashadowscol*`) from `Colorize_Framev2` instead of
  loading sparse vectors per pixel.
- Neighbor probing is done by iterating a compact offset table
  (8-connected neighbors) rather than repeated hand-written branch blocks.

Sprite matching prefilter:
- `Check_Spritesv2` builds an exact per-frame 32-bit dword index and skips
  detection-area scans for detection words that are not present.
- This replaces the Bloom prefilter path (no false positives from hash
  collisions).
- Shape-mode sprites use a separate exact dword index built from the binary
  `frameshape` domain, so shape detection words are not filtered against raw
  grayscale frame dwords.
- Detection-area verification uses precomputed opaque row-segment runs to avoid
  per-pixel checks on transparent sprite zones.

Background placeholder policy:
- `Colorize_Framev2` supports `suppressFrameBackgroundImage`.
- When true, frame-level background images are treated as placeholders and existing output pixel is kept in masked background areas.
- This is used when a background scene is active so the scene background can continue while foreground content changes.
- With background-scene flag `32`, dynamic-zone pixels whose selected dynamic
  palette color is black (`0`) are treated as background-scene holes when a
  frame background mask covers that pixel. These blacked-out dynamic pixels do
  not generate dynamic shadows, and the rule does not replace an already-written
  dynamic shadow pixel.

Mixed-resolution background scenes:
- `applySceneBackground` caches the already-rendered scene background together
  with its source dimensions.
- If a background scene and the current foreground are rendered on different
  planes because fallback selected the original-resolution foreground, the
  cached scene background is sampled into the target plane instead of being
  reused by raw flat-buffer index.
- This preserves correct background-scene composition for `64p` scene /
  `32p` fallback foreground and the inverse `32p` scene / `64p` fallback
  foreground case.

Critical-trigger fast rejection:
- While a non-interruptable scene (or its end-hold) is active, normal incoming
  frames are not always sent through full `Identify_Frame(...)`.
- `Serum_ColorizeWithMetadatav2Internal(...)` first checks a tiny precomputed
  subset containing only non-scene frames with trigger IDs:
  - `MONOCHROME_TRIGGER_ID`
  - `MONOCHROME_PALETTE_TRIGGER_ID`
- If no such critical trigger frame matches, the incoming frame is rejected
  immediately without full identification.
- This preserves important monochrome/service-menu transitions while avoiding
  most irrelevant input-frame work during non-interruptable scenes.
- If such a critical monochrome trigger frame does match, it is allowed to
  preempt the non-interruptable scene immediately; libserum stops the current
  scene/end-hold and processes the monochrome-trigger frame normally.

## Resolution scaling and the two-layer renderer

When the caller requests `64p` output and the content is `128x32`, libserum
produces the `64p` frame itself instead of handing back a `32p` frame for the
host to scale. This is what keeps a colorization looking the same in every
player.

### Layers

Rendering splits by *provenance*, not by plane:

- **HD-authored content** — `cframes_v2_extra`, `backgroundframes_v2_extra`,
  `backgroundmask_extra`, HD background scenes, and HD sprite art
  (`spritecolored_extra`) — rendered natively at `64p`.
- **ROM-driven content** — dynamic zones, sprites with no HD version, and the
  dynamic parts of sprites that do have HD art — rendered at original resolution
  and upscaled **once**, then composited on top.

`HasHdStaticContent()` gates the first layer. It deliberately does **not**
require every referenced sprite to have an HD version, unlike the historical
`CheckExtraFrameAvailable()`: sprites are their own layer now, so one without HD
art no longer forces the whole frame to discard its authored HD background.

**HD dynamic masks are ignored outright.** `dynamasks_extra` and friends carry no
spatial information the SD masks do not, and the authoring tool line-doubles
them, so honouring them produced blocky dynamic zones next to sharp statics. In
layer mode `frameHasDynamicExtra` is forced false, which also makes the extra
plane render the correct *underlay* beneath dynamic content.

### The coverage mask

`scaledLayerCoverage` (one byte per original-resolution pixel) records what the
scaled layer owns. Dynamic zones always; statics only when there are no HD
statics; a sprite's dynamic pixels always, its other pixels only when it has no
HD art. Pixels suppressed by `FLAG_SCENE_REPLACE_DYNAMIC_BLACK` are left unowned
so the HD background shows through.

The mask decides what the layer **contributes**. It does not decide how the
upscaler **rounds** — see the first invariant below, which is why the SD statics
are always rendered even when HD statics will cover them.

### Three invariants that are easy to break

**Select on `frame32`, never on an ownership-tagged key.** The scaled layer has
to round its edges exactly as a whole-frame upscale of the same picture would,
because that is what every other player produces. Feeding ownership into the
comparison breaks that along every layer boundary: black *outside* the layer and
black *inside* it stop comparing equal, so Scale2x's `b == h` guard — the thing
that preserves a glyph pixel sitting on the boundary — no longer fires and the
pixel is rounded away.

That was a real bug, and a subtle one: every glyph whose top row coincided with
the top of a dynamic zone lost its top row, on both the top and bottom edges of
the zone. It is also why the SD static render must always run. Skipping it when
HD statics cover it looks like free work to save, but it leaves `frame32`
incomplete, which is what forced the tagged key in the first place.

**Let the selected source decide painting, not the centre pixel.** If the
selection lands on an unowned pixel the destination is left to the HD layer —
that *is* the boundary being rounded. Falling back to the centre instead makes
every boundary pixel take the centre value, which for a thin feature such as a
one-pixel shadow is byte-identical to line doubling regardless of the algorithm
selected.

**Handle `kUpscaleSourceOutside`.** Outside the frame is black, not a copy of
the edge pixel — `FrameUtil` clamped there until `db067bc`, which made content
touching row 0 see its own colour "above" it, a false edge that trips the
rounding branch. Scores drawn on row 0 lost the tops of `8`, `S`, `0`, `9` and
`3`, and only there, because the same glyphs were intact at the bottom of the
frame.

Since outside is now a real value the selection can land on it, and
`SelectUpscaled2xSourceIndex()` then returns `kUpscaleSourceOutside` instead of
an index. The composite indexes `frame32`, `sdDynaLayerMap` and
`rotationsinframe32` with that result, so it **must** test for the sentinel
first; using it as an index reads far out of bounds. The layer simply paints
nothing there.

### Rotations

Rotation entries are carried through the upscale using the same source selection
as the colour, so `Serum_Rotate()` animates the composited frame directly with
no re-composite per tick.

The geometry is therefore frozen at colorize time: a rotation that changed a
colour enough to alter Scale2x's edge decisions would not be reflected. This is
deliberate. It requires a rotating colour to become *equal* to one of its
neighbours, which colorizations avoid — a rotation that momentarily matched its
surroundings would read as the background rotating.

**Constraint on new algorithms:** every algorithm in
`FrameUtil::ScalingAlgorithm` must be *selection-based*, so
`SelectUpscaled2xSourceIndex()` can express it. An interpolating scaler (hq2x,
xBR, bilinear) blends colours and produces pixels no rotation entry covers.

Still outstanding: on a frame with HD statics, scaled-layer pixels resolve their
rotation index against `colorrotations_v2` while the plane ships
`colorrotations_v2_extra`. The two are independently authored and can differ in
colour list, length *and* tick rate, so a rotating non-HD sprite on such a frame
animates against the wrong table. The fix is to keep both tables and tag each
pixel (`0x0100 | index` for the SD table), which needs a second set of slot
timers and `Calc_Next_Rotationv2()` scanning 8 slots rather than 4.

### Dynamic shadows

Shadows are generated **on the extra plane, from the upscaled glyph**
(`GenerateExtraPlaneShadows()`), not scaled up with the layer. Generating them at
original resolution gets the geometry wrong twice: the shadow outline is rounded
independently of the glyph's, and a one-pixel shadow becomes two pixels, which on
a tight glyph such as `8` closes the gap between its loops.

The composite carries each lit pixel's dyna layer into `hdDynaLayerMap`, which is
what lets the pass know which per-layer direction bitmask and colour apply. SD
shadows are still rendered for the `32p` output but are **not** covered, or they
would be drawn twice at two thicknesses.

The offset is a persisted per-colorization choice, `shadowOffsetMode`:
`SERUM_SHADOW_OFFSET_NATIVE` (1 extra-plane pixel — what the pre-layer renderer
produced, and what authors tuned against) or `_PROPORTIONAL` (2 pixels, matching
the `32p` output's relative thickness). Real colorizations disagree about which
looks right, hence the setting.

### Selection and persistence

`SERUM_SCALING_*` and `SERUM_SHADOW_OFFSET_*` live in `serum.h`; the shared
implementation is `FrameUtil::ScalingAlgorithm` in libframeutil, fetched into
`third-party/include` by `platforms/<platform>/<arch>/external.sh`. Both values
are stored in the `cROMc` header from concentrate version 8 and are overridable
per colorization through `altcolor/<romname>/scaling.txt`
(`read_scaling_sidecar()`), which is **not** read on a real machine — the stored
values are authoritative there, matching how `pup.csv` and `skip-cromc.txt` are
treated.

`Scale2xPreserve` (value `2`) is the default. It is Scale2x with one change:
where rounding a convex corner would replace a lit centre pixel with an empty
neighbour, the centre is kept. Reference Scale2x loses that pixel, which eats
five-pixel-tall DMD text. Value `0` is still reference Scale2x, unmodified, for
a colorization that wants exactly what other players produce.
The selector must never be gated on extra-plane geometry: the whole-frame upscale
runs precisely when there is no extra plane, and gating there silently made every
`32p`-only colorization fall back to line doubling.

## Scene playback and options
Scene data comes from CSV (`SceneGenerator`).

Flags (from `serum.h`):
- Scene finish behavior is selected by the low finish-mode bits: `0`, `1`, or
  `2`. Other scene flags are orthogonal and may be combined with that finish
  mode.
- `0` (default): keep the last scene frame visible when the scene finishes
  until a new normal frame is identified
- `1`: black when scene finished
- `2`: show previous frame when scene finished
- `4`: run scene as background
- `8`: only dynamic content in foreground over background scene
- `16`: resume interrupted scene if retriggered within 8s
- `32`: with background scenes, replace dynamic-zone pixels whose selected
  dynamic color is black with the background scene when covered by the frame
  background mask. These blacked-out dynamic pixels do not generate dynamic
  shadows, and the rule does not replace an already-written dynamic shadow
  pixel.

Finished-scene default behavior:
- Foreground scenes with flag `0` leave the last rendered scene frame visible
  until normal-frame identification resumes with a newly matched normal frame.
- If that next newly matched normal frame would immediately retrigger the same
  scene, libserum does not restart the scene and keeps the preserved last scene
  frame visible.
- Background scenes with flag `0` keep the last scene frame composited as
  background until a newly identified normal frame stops that background
  state.
- Same-trigger background-scene continuation does not clear that preserved
  background frame; it follows the historical seamless continuation path.

`startImmediately` behavior:
- `startImmediately` is honored for foreground scenes.
- Background scenes do not use foreground-style immediate takeover semantics.
- When a new background scene is armed, libserum immediately renders the first
  scene frame into background state and then continues by rendering the
  triggering normal frame in the foreground on the same call.
- Same-trigger background-scene continuation still uses the historical
  `IDENTIFY_SAME_FRAME` path so repeated trigger frames do not restart or
  recompose the scene between rotations.
- Foreground scenes still stop color rotations when they start immediately;
  background scenes do not.
- In preferred-extra runtime mode, scene rendering follows the same per-frame
  extra-first policy as normal frame colorization: if a scene frame has extra
  content, only the extra plane is prepared for that call; original-plane scene
  rendering is used only as `FLAG_REQUEST_FALLBACK` fallback when the extra
  scene frame is incomplete/unavailable.

## cROMc persistence
Current concentrate version: **6**.

`cROMc` stores the full Serum model and supports both Serum v1 and Serum v2
content. Real-machine policy may still restrict which source formats are
accepted at load time, but the persisted `cROMc` format itself is not v2-only.

Stored in v6:
- Full Serum model payload.
- Scene data (`SceneGenerator` scene vector).
- Scene lookup acceleration:
  - `frameIsScene`
  - `sceneFramesBySignature`
  - `normalFramesBySignature`
  - `normalIdentifyBuckets`
  - `frameToNormalBucket`
  - `sceneFrameIdByTriplet`
- Critical monochrome-trigger lookup:
  - `criticalTriggerFramesBySignature`
- Color-rotation lookup acceleration:
  - `colorRotationLookupByFrameAndColor`
- Derived lookup tables are serialized in canonical sorted-entry form instead of
  direct `unordered_map` archive order, so equal data yields equal `cROMc`
  bytes across platforms.
- `v6` `cROMc` archives are intended to be portable across supported
  platforms. A `cROMc` generated on one platform must load with the same
  semantics on another platform without archive-format forks or
  platform-specific compatibility branches.
- `SerumData::LoadFromFile()` must remain a streaming inflate path.
  - Do not switch file-based `cROMc` load to "read compressed payload + fully
    inflate to memory" just to reduce desktop startup time.
  - Low-memory devices depend on streaming archive load so the full inflated
    payload does not need to coexist in memory during direct file load.
  - `LoadFromBuffer()` may still use whole-buffer inflate because the caller
    has already materialized the archive in memory.
- Prepared-load metadata:
  - `hasAnyExtraFrame`
  - `publicTriggerCount`
- Sprite runtime sidecars:
  - `spriteCandidateOffsets`, `spriteCandidateIds`, `spriteCandidateSlots`
  - `frameHasShapeSprite`
  - `spriteWidth`, `spriteHeight`, `spriteUsesShape`
  - `spriteDetectOffsets`, `spriteDetectMeta`
  - `spriteOpaqueRowSegmentStart`, `spriteOpaqueRowSegmentCount`,
    `spriteOpaqueSegments`
- Scene data block uses guarded encoding (`SCD1` magic + bounded count) to
  prevent unbounded allocations on corrupted/misaligned input.
- Sparse vectors in packed sparse layout.
- Normalized sentinel vectors plus sidecar flag vectors for transparency and
  dynamic-zone activity.

Backward compatibility:
- v5 files are loadable.
- v5 sparse vectors are deserialized with legacy sparse-vector layout and converted to packed representation after load.
- For v5 loads, scene lookup vectors and other derived runtime sidecars may be rebuilt at startup.
- For direct `v6` loads, stored runtime sidecars are expected to be consumed as
  persisted runtime-ready data.
- For direct `v6` loads, stored scene/color-rotation lookup tables are reused
  directly; their persisted representation is platform-independent.
- For direct `v6` loads, prepared-load metadata is reused directly; `v5`
  compatibility loads still compute it at runtime.
- Cross-platform differences in `v6` behavior are treated as bugs in canonical
  persistence or runtime reconstruction, not as an acceptable reason to add
  platform-tagged `cROMc` variants.
- A `pup.csv` update in the same authoring-time load cycle may invalidate persisted scene lookup data and requires rebuild before re-save.
- Direct scene-triplet preprocessing is only executed for v6.
- v6 scene-data deserialization validates block magic and count before
  allocation.

v6 snapshot policy:
- Compatibility between unreleased v6 development snapshots is not required.
- Compatibility to released v5 remains required.
- Therefore:
  - if `v6` data needs new runtime-ready fields or stricter invariants, update
    the `v6` generation/load contract directly rather than adding fallback logic
    for older `v6` development snapshots.
  - do not introduce final-device runtime safety nets, repair paths, or
    compatibility shims merely to keep older `v6` development snapshots
    loading.

## Logging
- Central callback configured by `Serum_SetLogCallback`.
- `serum-decode.cpp` and `SceneGenerator.cpp` both use callback-based `Log(...)`.
- Windows DLL API-boundary crash diagnostics:
  - On MSVC Windows builds, exported `libserum` API entrypoints catch both C++
    exceptions and Windows structured exceptions (`SEH`) at the DLL boundary.
  - Fatal API-boundary failures are recorded in a process-global message buffer
    exposed through `Serum_GetLastErrorMessage()`.
  - Those fatal diagnostics are emitted through the configured log callback and
    also mirrored to `stderr` and `OutputDebugStringA`, so crash reasons remain
    visible even when the host does not install a log callback.
  - Structured-exception diagnostics include the Windows exception code, a
    short reason string, and the reported fault address; access violations also
    include whether the fault happened on read/write/execute and the target
    address when available.
- Successful load logging includes Serum runtime version and, for `cROMc`
  loads, the concentrate version.
- Under `SERUM_DEBUG_SCENE_VERBOSE=1`, `SceneGenerator::parseCSV(...)` logs a
  one-line parse summary with parsed scene count, skipped invalid-line count,
  and final active state. Use this first when a found `.pup.csv` still appears
  to yield `0` rotation scene frames.
- Missing-file logs from `find_case_insensitive_file(...)` use normalized path joining.
- Optional runtime debug tracing is env-gated and split by verbosity:
  - `SERUM_DEBUG_TRACE_INPUTS=1` enables high-level lifecycle logs (input,
    trigger, scene-info).
  - `SERUM_DEBUG_IDENTIFY_VERBOSE=1` enables per-candidate identification logs.
  - `SERUM_DEBUG_SPRITE_VERBOSE=1` enables sprite candidate/detection/rejection
    logs.
  - `SERUM_DEBUG_SCENE_VERBOSE=1` enables scene-path and scene-event logs.
    It also emits compact scene-lookup persistence summaries at `cROMc`
    save/load time (`pre-save`, `post-load-file`, `post-load-buffer`) with
    counts for `frameIsScene`, `sceneFramesBySignature`, and
    `sceneFrameIdByTriplet`, which is the primary debug surface for
    scene-related direct-`v6` load mismatches.
  - `SERUM_DEBUG_INPUT_CRC`, `SERUM_DEBUG_FRAME_ID`, and
    `SERUM_DEBUG_STAGE_HASHES=1` remain available as output filters and
    expensive hash tracing controls.
  - Debug-only identify/sprite/stage-hash lines must stay silent by default
    and may only appear when the corresponding env-gated debug mode is enabled.
- Optional runtime profiling:
  - If env `SERUM_PROFILE_LOAD_TIMES=1`, startup load timing is logged for the
    major load stages. This emits:
    - archive-level timing from `SerumData::LoadFromFile/LoadFromBuffer`
      (`Perf load archive: ... total=... deserialize=...`)
    - top-level startup timing from `Serum_Load(...)`
      (`Perf load total: ...`)
    - Use this first when comparing `v5` vs `v6` startup regressions, because
      it separates archive deserialize cost from post-load restore/rebuild
      stages.
  - If env `SERUM_PROFILE_DYNAMIC_HOTPATHS` is enabled (`1/true/on/yes`),
    periodic average timings are logged for the full end-to-end rendered-frame
    round trip (`frame`), `Colorize_Framev2`, and `Colorize_Spritev2`, along
    with average identification time (`Identify_Frame`) split into
    normal/scene calls plus the critical-trigger mini-matcher, input/result
    counters (`inputs`, `rendered`, `same`, `noFrame`), and current process
    RSS memory usage and process-local peak RSS seen so far.
  - `Perf dynamic avg` is emitted on fixed 240-input host windows, not on
    rendered-output count, so runs stay comparable even when different
    branches suppress or render different numbers of frames from the same dump.
    The window size is conveyed by `inputs=...`; no extra trailer is appended.
  - If env `SERUM_PROFILE_DYNAMIC_HOTPATHS_WINDOWED=1`, the same counters are
    reset after each emitted 240-input block so each `Perf dynamic avg` line
    reflects only the most recent window rather than a cumulative average.
  - The same profiler also logs a one-time startup summary before normal frame
    processing begins:
    `Perf startup peak: start=...MiB current=...MiB peak=...MiB stage=...`
    where `peak` is the highest sampled RSS observed during the load pipeline.
  - If env `SERUM_PROFILE_SPARSE_VECTORS=1`, sparse-vector access snapshots are
    logged at the same cadence (accesses, decode count, cache hits, direct hits)
    for key runtime vectors (`cframes_v2*`, `backgroundmask*`, `dynamasks*`,
    `dynaspritemasks*`).

## Safety invariants
- `frameIsScene.size()` must equal `nframes` before identification.
- `sceneFramesBySignature` must correspond to current scene data and current loaded frame definitions.
- `sceneFrameIdByTriplet` (when present) must correspond to current scene data.
- Any change to scene generation domain (`mask/shape/hash`), sparse-vector serialization layout, or cROMc schema requires updating this file.

## How to validate after changes
Minimum validation:
1. Build: `cmake --build build -j4`
2. Load scenarios:
   - cROM/cRZ without CSV
   - cROM/cRZ with CSV
   - cROMc v5 with CSV update
   - cROMc v6 without CSV update
3. Verify log line:
   - `Loaded <normal> frames and <scene> rotation scene frames`
4. Verify scene behaviors:
   - background scene
   - end-of-scene behavior flags
   - resume flag `16`
10. Build color-rotation lookup index via `BuildColorRotationLookup()` during
    v5 / authoring-time rebuild flows so persisted v6 data provides O(1)
    `ColorInRotation` checks without direct-load fallback.
    - `SerumData::SaveToFile()` must ensure
      `colorRotationLookupByFrameAndColor` is populated before serializing
      `v6`; otherwise direct `v6` load will rebuild the lookup at startup and
      incur avoidable load-time cost.
